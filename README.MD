Abandoned software, do not ask for support. This is only here because it's the download link on GBATemp.  
  
This a basic image viewer for the 3ds. It can't zoom and can't load big images. For info on how to use this, view the [GBATemp thread](https://gbatemp.net/threads/release-manga-reader.399276/).   
  
There is PS Vita support for this application because I wanted to see how it would run out of curiosity. There's no reason for it to be used by anybody. Use VitaShell or [this homebrew](https://github.com/MyLegGuy/MangaDownloader-Vita).
